## Technologies Used

#### Frontend

- **React.js**: The app is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows us to create reusable UI components and ensures that the app is highly responsive and performs well on all devices. It is used for managing the state of the app, handling user interactions, and dynamically rendering content.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: The app heavily uses modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, promises, async/await, destructuring, and more. These features help simplify the code and make it more readable and efficient.
- **CSS (Custom Styling)**: The app's design is fully customized using CSS. We started with TailwindCSS for rapid prototyping, then translated it into custom CSS for better control and uniqueness. CSS handles the layout, responsiveness, colors, animations, and overall user experience.
- **Additional Libraries**: 
  - Font Awesome (for icons)
  - Fetch API (for client-server communication)
  - JsonResponse (for backend responses)
- **FontAwesome**: For iconography, we used FontAwesome icons to provide clean, scalable vector icons for buttons, links, and other UI components.

#### Backend

- **Django**: While the app is frontend-focused, it can integrate with a Django backend for features like user authentication, data storage, and secure API endpoints. This adds a layer of security and allows for user data, program enrollments, and challenge completions to be stored and retrieved from a server.

#### Other Tool

-**React Router**: For navigation between pages such as Home, Programs, Challenges, and Dashboard, we used React Router to create a single-page application (SPA) experience, ensuring smooth transitions without page reloads.
- **Git**: Version control is managed using Git, allowing us to track changes and collaborate easily.
